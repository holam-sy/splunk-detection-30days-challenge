# 30 Days of Splunk Detection
*Personal learning challenge to practice daily SIEM detections.*

---

## 📖 About this challenge
This is my **personal 30-day challenge** to practice Splunk detection skills.  
I am completing all tasks and recording my notes by training on the [SOCLabs Platform](https://www.soc-labs.top),  
which provides interactive SOC labs and real log datasets.  

The idea is simple:  
- Practice Splunk detections every day  
- Build a public learning log that others can follow
- Chat-GPT4o helps me quickly acquire some knowledge

## 🛠️ Tools I Use
- Splunk Free / Splunk Cloud Trial  
- [SOCLabs Platform](https://www.soc-labs.top) — provides interactive labs and real datasets for practice  

> Note: You don’t need SOC-Labs to follow along, but I personally use it and it makes practice easier.
